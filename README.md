# Three-Stage-CMOS-Amplifier
Analog amplifier design project using Cadence Virtuoso 90nm technology

Tools: Cadence Virtuoso
Skills: Analog Design, AC/DC/Transient Analysis, Stability, Compensation

Objective:
To design a high-gain, stable three-stage CMOS amplifier in 90nm technology with Miller compensation.

What I Did:
Designed the 3-stage topology
Added Miller compensation for stability
Performed DC, AC, and transient analysis
Optimized for gain and phase margin

Key Results:
85 dB gain
> 60° phase margin
Low-frequency stability ensured
Good settling behavior in transient analysis
